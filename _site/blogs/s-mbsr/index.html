            <h1>Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction</h1>
<h3>The 8-week MBSR course is for anyone interested in boosting their wellbeing, by finding new ways to live with more energy, focus and compassion.</h3>
<p>Itâ€™s designed to support you if you are experiencing, or have experienced, stress, anxiety, depression or chronic pain which negatively impacts your life.</p>
<p>With a maximum of 10 people, you will learn about mindfulness through a variety of different meditations, group discussions and teachings. Read <a href="/testimonials">testimonials </a>from past participants.</p>
<p>Amongst other things, over the course of 8 weeks you will learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to be aware of your body and how this can support you in difficult or stressful situations</li>
<li>How to be more compassionate, gentle and kind to yourself and other people and the transformative impact this can have on your life</li>
<li>About the negativity bias and ways in which you can rewire your brain to balance this with more positive experiences</li>
<li>Why people tend to react the way they do and how mindfulness helps you to respond in better ways</li>
<li>How to be aware of thoughts instead of caught up in them, believing them all. This awareness can lead to life changing behaviours through having more confidence, self-compassion and ambition</li>
</ul>
<p>The course comprises a two-hour session every week for eight weeks. To get the most out of the experience, home practice will also be recommended.</p>
