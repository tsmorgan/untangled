<p>The start of a new year can feel so exciting! For me it feels like I’m entering a new chapter with refreshed hope of what a whole new year can bring.</p>
<p>Many people set new year’s resolutions to try to improve some aspect of themselves and their life. This can of course be helpful and lead to positive changes, but the reality is that most people lose motivation and don’t achieve the resolutions they’ve set. It makes me wonder how that must feel and whether people are understanding and kind to themselves at that time, or more judgmental and critical. I suspect the latter.</p>
<p>We’re living in the most uncertain times I’ve ever known. There’s more change affecting every one of us than we ever imagined. It can feel like things are out of control and this can have a serious effect on our mental health and wellbeing.</p>
<p>In the past I would do anything I could to try to be in control of things around me, which usually meant vast amounts of planning, thinking that if I could just get everything organised then everything would be OK, and I’d know what to expect. I realised a few years ago how unhealthy this obsession with control and perfection was.</p>
<p>If the last couple of years have taught me anything it’s that life’s unpredictable!</p>
<p>It’s made me realise how valuable my mindfulness practice is. Mindfulness allows me to find stability within regardless of what’s happening around me. It helps me feel grounded and calm which helps me to move through life’s challenges in a better way. It helps me to accept and allow whatever is happening without judgment, instead of fighting against reality. It helps me to notice the good things in life that I’d otherwise miss if I just lived life in my head, and there are good things – even in these worrying and turbulent times!</p>
<p>Perhaps this new year, instead of setting resolutions which put pressure on you to do more and be more, you could allow yourself to be just as you are. This could be transformational and reduce your stress levels and increase your happiness.</p>
