Today is World Meditation Day, a day to raise awareness about meditating and the benefits it brings for most people. In support of this, I've recorded a short breath meditation for you.  
  
Although this video is focused just on the breath, that's not for everyone. One of the things I love about meditating is that there is such a wide range of ways to practice! On the 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction course I teach all kinds of meditations and different practices click with different people. Some other types of meditations are on past videos I've recorded, which I've linked to below, so if you are wanting to try something else feel free to take a look:
