Find out how mindfulness can help you to be less reactive and more grounded in this video, something which can bring huge benefits to your life and to the lives of people around you.   

It includes a short standing meditation to give you a very brief flavour of it. 

If you want to find out more or want to try a longer meditation with my support and coaching then [get in touch](/contact)! I'd love to hear from you
