Yesterday I went on a mindfulness meditation retreat which included a silent mindful walk in nature. I felt immersed in the surroundings and noticed my own response to them. 

Here’s a poem to share what I noticed. 

**Patience** 

Spring is on its way,

appearing slow and steady, 

but you can’t rush it,

it will spring when it is ready. 

I notice it and watch,

full of hopeful anticipation,

I want it here now,

but I must wait, be patient.

Just like our growth,

our own Spring will arrive, 

after winter’s stillness, 

we’ll unfold, feeling alive.

I’ll practice being patient, 

listening to my body,

and place trust in the seasons,

I’ll emerge when I’m ready.
