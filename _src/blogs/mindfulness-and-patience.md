In this video I share how mindfulness has helped me to be more patient and present in life instead of always living for the future, a future that never arrives.

Why does that matter though, I hear you ask?

When I am impatient I am:

❌ More stressed and anxious

❌ Less focused

❌ Unable to listen to others skilfully

❌ Missing my life

When I am patient I:

✔️Am calmer 

✔️Am more present 

✔️Can actively listen to others and so I have better relationships

✔️Notice more joyful moments in life which boosts my wellbeing
