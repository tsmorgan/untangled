I was recently a guest on the ‘Feeling Good in Finance’ podcast with career coach Katie Pope.

In it I talk about the finance profession and mental health, my work in social housing which spans over 20 years and, of course, mindfulness and the impact it’s had on my work and personal life!

It was a great experience and not one I thought I’d ever have given that 10 years ago I had a fear of public speaking, which mindfulness helped me to overcome!
