Last week was quite momentous for various reasons and coupled with that I didn't feel 100%. 

One of the things this all affected was my sleep and by Saturday I felt tired and groggy and had for a few days. 

Despite this, I decided to go for a big walk in nature and it was exactly what the doctor ordered! 

In this short video I explain why it was the right thing for me to do and how it helped to energise me ❤️
