In this short video I share how mindfulness has helps me to be more present for my life through noticing the sounds around me. I took this on my dog walk this morning and there were so many sounds to notice! 

This made a huge difference 10 years ago when I started practising mindfulness because it helped me to listen to my children when I picked them up from school, instead of being lost in work thoughts. 

It helps me now every day to be more present for my life as it unfolds and to actually hear and see the world around me and the people in it.
