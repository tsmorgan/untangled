👉 Your life is whatever you pay attention to, and **you can choose what you pay attention to**, but it doesn’t seem that way when you live life on autopilot, lost in your thoughts!  
  
💭 Mindfulness has helped me to notice my thoughts without getting caught up in them and to return my attention to whatever it is that I want to focus on.  
  
💪 Meditation is the training ground for this.  
  
🧠These images show the thoughts that appeared when I sat in meditation. Many of these were repeated over and over again. When thoughts arise in meditation I acknowledge them, label them and then gently return my attention back to my focus, which in today’s practice was my breath.  
  
⭐ By doing this I have space around the thoughts.  
  
⭐ The point isn’t to get better at meditation but to notice the patterns of my thinking and to develop the capacity to return my attention to whatever it is I am focusing on in daily life, without getting caught up in my own judgments, living avoiding discomfort or to only live in the future.  
  
⭐ In the last image replace ‘breath’ with whatever it is you’re focusing on, whether that’s the person you’re have a conversation with, the sounds around you as you walk, the piece of work you’re trying to complete or another focus of your attention during a meditation practice etc.  
  
The benefits are huge and, to name but a few, they include:  
✔️ Better relationships  
✔️ Improved focus and concentration  
✔️ More self-awareness  
✔️ Better decision making  
✔️ Increased productivity  
✔️ More empathy  
✔️ More able to understand others’ perspectives  
✔️ Lower stress levels  
✔️ More resilience
