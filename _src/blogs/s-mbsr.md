# Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction

### The 8-week MBSR course is for anyone interested in boosting their wellbeing, by finding new ways to live with more energy, focus and compassion.

Itâ€™s designed to support you if you are experiencing, or have experienced, stress, anxiety, depression or chronic pain which negatively impacts your life.

With a maximum of 10 people, you will learn about mindfulness through a variety of different meditations, group discussions and teachings. Read [testimonials ](/testimonials)from past participants. 

Amongst other things, over the course of 8 weeks you will learn:

* How to be aware of your body and how this can support you in difficult or stressful situations
* How to be more compassionate, gentle and kind to yourself and other people and the transformative impact this can have on your life
* About the negativity bias and ways in which you can rewire your brain to balance this with more positive experiences
* Why people tend to react the way they do and how mindfulness helps you to respond in better ways
* How to be aware of thoughts instead of caught up in them, believing them all. This awareness can lead to life changing behaviours through having more confidence, self-compassion and ambition

The course comprises a two-hour session every week for eight weeks. To get the most out of the experience, home practice will also be recommended.
