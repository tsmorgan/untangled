I wouldn’t expect to be physically strong and healthy if I didn’t exercise and mental health is no different.   
  
Practicing mindfulness builds mental strength in the same way that lifting a weight builds physical strength.  
  
With mindfulness you build the mental capacity to be aware of the present moment and to notice what’s happening in your life without judgment.   
  
It helps you to see things clearly, including your own reaction to what’s happening, and with that awareness, you can respond to life in better ways, as opposed to from a place of emotional reactivity often with higher levels of stress and anxiety.  
  
It strengthens your ability to focus your attention on where you want it to be. You’ll notice all the distractions that try to pull you away from that focus but instead of getting distracted you can return your attention back to where you want it to be (over and over again).  
  
It develops the capacity to be resilient, focused, empathetic, grounded and helps to improve relationships too.

Having said this, when you exercise for physical health you still get ill and suffer with aches and pains. It doesn’t prevent that from ever happening but it can reduce the risk of it happening and improve your immunity to support your recovery. This is just the same as meditating and practicing mindfulness for mental health. It’s not a panacea but it helps you to notice more quickly when you’re struggling mentally and to take steps to look after yourself, which means you can recover and bounce back more quickly.
