In this short video I share some information about stress itself, my personal experience of it and how I've learnt ways to be more resilient and manage stress in a better way through mindfulness.

  
Try this 3 minute [guided mindfulness meditation ](/blogs/feet-on-floor-body-on-chair)which might support you if you are feeling stressed or ungrounded today. 

If you want to find out more or want to try a longer meditation with my support and coaching then [get in touch](/contact)! I'd love to hear from you.
