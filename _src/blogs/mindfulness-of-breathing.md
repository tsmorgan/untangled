It’s the New Year and often it’s a bit of a shock to the system when we have to dive back into work after a break, and it can be hard to keep our boundaries and to stick to our good intentions that we'd set for ourselves!

If this sounds familiar and you're already feeling your stress levels rising, I've recorded a short mindfulness of the breath practice to help you in your day. It might be just what you need. 

  
You may be thinking "What?" 'You cannot be serious!" "I don't have time for that!"

  
But mindfulness doesn't need to be another thing to do. You're already breathing and so this is simply noticing that. Even just noticing one breath can be helpful.

  
Noticing the breath can be supportive for many people. It can create a sense of calmness and of feeling grounded, which can be especially helpful when you feel stressed or overwhelmed. It can help you to then move forward in your day with more focus and resilience, and be more productive too!
